                    <p>ITEMs can be ported across the entire Ethereum universe. Buy them as potions for the next raid in your favorite ETH-based game, earn DAI by borrowing other in-game ITEMs, farm Cryptovoxel items, and do so much more.</p>

                    <h2>The ITEM Standard</h2>
                    <p>ITEM is a new object standard on top of Ethereum. It synergizes the properties of the three most common interfaces—ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155—and is thus interoperable with all existing Ethereum applications. By taking advantage of the sophisticated engineering behind ERC1155s, ITEMs can be used as an ERC20, ERC721 or as an ERC1155 as required.</p>
                    <p>ITEMs don’t need centralized storage to save objectId info. NFT data is saved in a specific ERC20 token that can also work as a standalone one, and allow for the transfer of parts of an atomic object. The ERC20 implementation has a unique Token Id, and its supply is the entire supply of that Token Id.</p>
                    <p>EthItems are designed to be extendable. Every new Collection can be hosted by a specific wallet, or better yet by a Smart Contract that has the right to mint new Items. This allows all developers to build their own minting rules and create an entire decentralized application based on it in a totally reusable general-purpose way. This is because, for the first time, the application’s logic (e.g. for a videogame) is fully decoupled from the NFT implementation itself.</p>
                    <h5>Wrapped ITEMs & Native ITEMs</h5>
                    <figure class="infop">

                    </figure>
                    <p>Native ITEMs are a Collection’s objects that, via their Extensions, can perform complex behaviors specified optionally in the Extension logic. These extra capabilities are up to the developers writing the Extension logic.</p>
                    <p>Wrapped ITEMs, on the other hand, retain all the capabilities of the default ITEM standard, but lose any extra ones while wrapped. You can wrap all of the existing ERC721, ERC1155 and ERC20 into Items, by making them interoperable tokens on top of Ethereum. Save gas batch-swapping ERC20s. Farm ERC1155s in DeFi dApps. Swap ERC721s on DExes. A world of possibilities awaits you.</p>

                    <h2>Integrate Your dApp With ITEMs</h2>
                    <p>Building on top of the ITEM standard is a cool new way to make dApps more decentralized and interoperable, while avoiding many common technical problems.</p>
                    <p><b>Some General Unaddressed Issues In ETH Development</b></p>
                    <p>Developing applications on top of Ethereum is one of the biggest challenges in tech—for teams big and small—due to a lack of resources and limitations with the blockchain. The most difficult thing is building applications that are general-purpose and decentralized by design, which is to say unreliant on any sort of centralized decision-making.</p>
                    <p>By limiting dependence on third-party intermediaries, the ITEM architecture is designed to resolve these and other major issues facing dApps today.</p>
                    <p><b>Token Tracking Solution</b></p>
                    <p>One highly controversial and challenging problem in Ethereum development is the tracking of all existing tokens. It is impossible for a dApp to do this efficiently without relying on intermediary servers, forcing it to program its frontend—the most centralized and difficult to govern part—with echelons of hardcoded addresses. This puts it in the uncomfortable and untenable position of arbitrarily prioritizing some projects over others in order to improve their user experience.</p>
                    <p><b>Shared, Upgradable and Backward-Compatible Standards</b></p>
                    <p>Non-standard ERC implementations are a nightmare for dApp developers. The most popular example is USDT, valued at more than $17B. Just to be able to manage USDT, dApps are forced to hardcode their Smart Contracts with customized implementations.</p>
                    <p>ITEMs, however, all share the same standard methods. It is in fact impossible for them not to. Using ITEMs, dApp developers can finally work together on building amazing things without having to deal with broken ERC20s, non-standard interpretations of ERC1155, and so on…</p>
                    <p>The ITEM standard can also be upgraded via the ETHITEM DFO to new versions that incorporate new standards alongside the evolution of the Ethereum Ecosystem. But anytime the EthITEM DFO does upgrade the factory contract, this doesn’t automatically upgrade ITEMs of an older version. It enables ITEMs to upgrade themselves, and allows them to easily switch back and forth between old and new versions.</p>
                    <p><b>Easy Wrap and Unwrap</b></p>
                    <p>Building with ITEMs ensures total interoperability with every Token and dApp that exists on the Ethereum Network. Using the ETHITEM standard methodology, you can build any kind of dApp to interact with ITEMs by wrapping and unwrapping user funds in the background. </p>
                    <p><b>Batch Transfers</b></p>
                    <p>Fun fact: ERC1155 implementation permits one of the most interesting—yet seldom used—applications in the Ethereum ecosystem. This is the “batch transfer”. ITEMs are ready to use this functionality in dApps, allowing you to easily develop the transferral of different ITEMs from the same collection. This makes transfers cheaper than ever before, and opens up the opportunity to work on even more exotic and complex features like batch swaps. 💥</p>
                    <p><b>Metadata Implementation</b></p>
                    <p>Metadata is a standard used in the ERC721 and ERC1155 ecosystems to express a token’s real information based on how creators manage the tokenUri link. In the ERC20 ecosystem, the most used info sources are the Etherscan servers and the Trust Wallet repo. Whenever you see a token logo on famous dApps, for example, you're trusting the Trust Wallet repo on GitHub.</p>
                    <p>Using the ITEM standard, every token has a tokenUri with all of the official information needed to build a frontend without needing to deal with third parties. The most important benefit to security here is that the right to update the tokenURI of a token is with the owner. If the owner is a wallet, they fully control this info. If the owner is an on-chain org, or a smart contract with custom functionalities, the metadata can be upgraded directly via voting or other specific functions. No ITEM token owner has to rely on assumptions about third-party security.</p>

                    <p>Items is a Decentralized Flexible Organization (DFO). Thanks to the DFOhub standard, the Items dApp is entirely independent from any off-chain entity. The $ARTE voting token is the programmable equity of the Items DFO; $ARTE holders hold real equity of the protocol, and rule every part of its code and assets.</p> 
                    <p>Items fees The Items DFO will be able to vote on two small possible fees for minting/burning ITEMs.In the beginning, Items fees are set to 0, but once DFOhub upgrades to v0.5, $ARTE token holders will be able to vote via a subDAO to set a fee between 0.0001% and 0.01% for the creation/wrapping and/or burning/unwrapping of Items. From the ECO update onward, the earnings of the Items DFO will be managed by token holders via code-based proposals at the DFO level and via subDAO applications on top.</p>
